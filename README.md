# PlaygroundOpenGL
A repository with easy cross platform setup for learning OpenGL and testing OpenGL samples


To build the samples it's needed to setup the build system.
This is done through calling `generate.cmd` or if you're on UNIX `generate.sh`.
*Please note down that requirement is a C++17 compatible compiler. So Visual Studio 2017 or supporting g++ / clang compilers are a requirement!
